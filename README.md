# BOSCH_Route_Optimization_Algorithm
1.) To develop a route optimization algorithm that caters to the real time changing demand of customers to determine route and schedule of buses depending on the constraints provided.    
2.) The algorithm should be able to give optimized routes for ‘n’ number of constraints , for example the desired output should be achieved with either one of the constraints as well as considering all of them together as per the requirements.      
3.)Justification and visualization of the method.
